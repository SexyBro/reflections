This was a very interesting way to see what was different between the two files.

It's efficient if a programmer can go back and look at how a program used to handle a problem in the past because that will usually tell the programmer how to pinpoint the problem of a troubled problem they are currently working with.

The good thing about a manual commit is that you will always be committing after a certain change has been made, and you can specify what that change was.
The bad part about this is that someone might forget to commit for a while or might not know when it's right to commit.

Git allows multiple files to be saved in one commit because all the files could be dependent upon each other.
Google Docs treats each file separately because it doesn't have repositories.

Git log can tell you the commit ids and git diff can tell you the differences between two commits.

If my changes do break the program, then I still have a working backup copy saved so that I can go back and use the program again the way it was before.

I want to use git to store copies of my Android Apps.
